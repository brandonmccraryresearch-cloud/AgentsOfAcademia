Tier 3, Task 3.4: Higgs VEV Derivation from D₄ Lattice Potential

The manuscript claims v = E_P × α⁹ × π⁵ × 9/8 ≈ 246.64 GeV, but
acknowledges (line 62) that "the exponent and geometric prefactors are
determined by a combination of dimensional reasoning and numerical fitting
rather than rigorous derivation from the lattice action."

This script attempts to:
1. Derive the α⁹ exponent from impedance cascade on D₄
2. Compute the geometric prefactor π⁵ × 9/8 from lattice symmetry
3. Evaluate the lattice effective potential to extract v
4. Provide honest assessment of what is derivation vs fitting

The claimed mechanism (§VI.1, Review5): The α⁹ exponent should emerge
from 9 successive impedance-cascade steps in the D₄ phonon propagator,
each contributing one factor of α. The path is:
  E_P → (acoustic impedance matching)⁹ → v

The 9 steps arise from:
  - 4 spatial dimensions (4 propagation channels)
  - 4 branches per dimension (1 longitudinal + 3 transverse)
  - 1 breathing mode (ARO)
  Total: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 impedance steps
